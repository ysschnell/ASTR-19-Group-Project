# ASTR-19-Group-Project
Group Project for ASTR-19

To work on this project, we collaborated through the use of individual jupyter notebooks, which we reviewed and edited as a group during zoom meetings. Although there is a lack of use of GitHub mechanicisms used, we still worked together and completed equal amounts of work!
